# CNN-GRU-Network
I want to reimpelent the method of CLSTM from : https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9289466, see what probelms they solved and we can build our new method as comparison models see https://github.com/adryanfitra/CNN-GRU-Network/blob/main/CNN_LSTM.ipynb

Collect data for journal preparation about PdM, Machine Learning, Google Colab for computation, and other

Implementation Data augmentation for balancing and increarsing number the dataset

Collect other datasets and other refrence methods as baseline methods see https://github.com/makinarocks/awesome-industrial-machine-datasets

Try to review part of machine learning, PdM, and server computation, Google colab pro, to determine the method and material for introduction

Implementation of other methods that is CNN+LSTM Method better than LSTM, Let see which one is better method for RUL see https://github.com/adryanfitra/CNN-GRU-Network/blob/main/CNN_LSTM.ipynb

Impelementation of GRU https://github.com/adryanfitra/CNN-GRU-Network/blob/main/RUL_GRU.ipynb
